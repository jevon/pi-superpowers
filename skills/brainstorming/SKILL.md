# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue. Understand first, explore options, then present the design in digestible sections.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommendation and reasoning

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and revise

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use the `git-workflow` skill to create an isolated workspace
- Use the `planning` skill to create a detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** — easier than open-ended
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** — always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** — present in sections, validate each
